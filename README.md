# memory_game
This repository contains another project, i took the base idea and the code structure from @Lorenzo6245, i just wanted to exercise my skills, the two projects are quite different but just wanted to give credits! Soo huge shoutout to my dear friend @Lorenzo6245 for making this project possible, i hope you will like it! :)

"""for using this program as i intended it u need to run it in your computer cmd's, using IDE cmd's or thirth party ones may cause unintended behaviour!"""
